<p>Downloads CraftBukkit and Spigot jars from https://getbukkit.org/, since they don't provide and API (the one they have is paid, and is not even available) lets do it in a other way
</p>
<p>
There is also a script to generate Multicraft config files to the downloaded jars.

</p>
**Usage:**
<p>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
</p>
<p>
`python downloadjars.py`
</p>
